Hi, I’m Michael, or @mikethemoog.
I am a musician, synth enthusiast, product designer and electronics lightweight (I can follow along and build).

I desperately want to build a modular synth, with a custom layout, using whatever circuits I can find.
Other projects include a left-hand glovette user device for computer, currently in late-prototype.
And there's always coding isn't there?

Cheers.
